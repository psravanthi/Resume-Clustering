# Resume-Clustering

What distinguishes a data scientist from a data analyst? Or how is a data engineer different from a data scientist?
  
I tried to answer some these questions. Applied natural language processing and topic modeling techniques (nltk, LDA, k-means and hierarchical clustering) to cluster resumes in the field of Data Analytics.
